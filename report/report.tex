\section{Lessons Learned}
Previously, I (Emma) didn't have experience developing in Android because I took 2110 after the Android Project was scrapped from the syllabus. I had to get used to a lot of new aspects of coding/Java that I never dealt with before, such as XML files, intents, activities, fragments, and etc. Through this project, I better understand the underlying aspects that go into creating something as simple as a button on a screen, and all the different steps it takes to go from having said button pop up on the screen, have a click registered, and transfer data. The trials and errors I went through while working on my app taught me a lot about streamlining development as well as writing generally good, understandable code.
